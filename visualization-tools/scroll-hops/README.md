To run this you must first obtain a local file of the user trace data. We have omited this file from our repository to to performance (it is very large) and privacy (it contains data about user device, browser, etc) issues.

It requires a server and a client both running. First install:

```
npm run install
```

Then start the server:

```
node server.js
```

And in a different shell, start the client.

```
npm start
```

This will open in your browser. View it only in the **Safari browser**.
